# MemorySanitizer suppressions for SPLAT!
#
# MSan detects uninitialized values in system libraries that were not compiled
# with MSan instrumentation. These are false positives since we cannot control
# how system libraries are built.
#
# MSan requires ALL code (including dependencies) to be compiled with -fsanitize=memory
# which is not feasible for system libraries like GDAL, PROJ, libpng, libjpeg, etc.
#
# See TESTING.md for details on MSan limitations.

# Suppress warnings from PROJ library (used by GDAL)
fun:*libproj.so*

# Suppress warnings from GDAL library
fun:*libgdal.so*

# Suppress warnings from other system libraries
fun:*libc.so*
fun:*libstdc++.so*
